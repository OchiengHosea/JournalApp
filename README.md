# JournalApp

This app stores your journals and keeps their track whether you have completed them or no,
simple navigation buttons are made to facilitate adding, viewing, editing and even deleting of this app
it requires you to have a google account to sign in.

I thank the Udacity and Andela and Google guys for the materials they have supplied that have improved
my skill to this level.

I believe there is more to learn and the hard stuff is always: to break the foundation of learning,
and they just helped me to do that.
